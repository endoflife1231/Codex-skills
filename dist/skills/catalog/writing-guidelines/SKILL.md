# Writing Guidelines

Review files for compliance with Writing Guidelines.

## How It Works

1. Fetch the latest guidelines from the source URL below
2. Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
3. Check against all rules in the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings in the terse `file:line` format

## Guidelines Source

Fetch fresh guidelines before each review:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel-labs/writing-guidelines/main/command.md
```

Use Codex web browsing when available. In a local CLI environment without browsing, use a network-approved `curl -fsSL` request to the source URL. If neither path is available, ask the user to provide the current guideline text and explicitly state that freshness was not verified. Never pretend a stale bundled copy is current.

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:
1. Fetch guidelines from the source URL above
2. Read the specified files
3. Apply all rules from the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.
